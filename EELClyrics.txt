Walking on campus
Thinking about my future
I’ve lost my way in the oceans
When can I find myself?
I look up to the sky
“Stella, can you tell me?”

People make fun of my naivety
People try to look down on me
But my mom always tells me 
“Believe in yourself”
I know I will succeed one day

Even if the world turns around
The faith in my heart will not waver
This is fate’s challenges
It’s also a promise to myself
I am a Ferrari! 
I am unstoppable!

Facing those mocking bystanders
Turn around decisively
I’ll prove that I’m not a coward
Facts speak louder than words
Hold my own hand tightly and say goodbye to confusion

No matter how slim the hope is
we will win even if we challenge it thousands of times
The stars will guide the way you want
Your efforts push you up to the moon
And you say to all people
“Vamos”

Even if the world turns around
The faith in my heart will not waver
This is fate’s challenges
It’s also a promise to myself
I am my mama pound 
I am superhero!

When you look back
The road you walked
Your sweat on your head
WE ARE INFINITY!
